=======================

This is a port of the Oberon RISC5 system for the Pepino FPGA board. Both the LX9 and the LX25 version of Pepino are supported.

Changes from the original code
------------------------------

- A DCM is used generated a 25 MHz system clock and a 75 MHz video clock that are in phase
- The SRAM write signal is genereated using a DDR output buffer
- The DCM in the video module is removed and replaced with a clock input from the main DCM
- SD card activity LED added
- The video system is modifed to 3-bit RGB (each pixel takes up 4 bits in video memory)

Binaries are available in the ISE folder.
